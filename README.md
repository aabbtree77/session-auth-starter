## Introduction

This is a starter template for a web app with a session-based user name and password authentication, no email communication and password resets.

The complete tech stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Astro, React, Lucia v3, SQLite, and Drizzle ORM (the latter not yet).

The code is based on "Lucia Astro User Name Password" example provided in Lucia docs. If you want to start with it instead, I provide a few details in the next section, otherwise skip it and see my adjustments. 

## Setup "Lucia Astro UserName Password" Demo

1. Clone [the demo](https://lucia-auth.com/tutorials/username-and-password/astro) sample code.

    cd to a folder and run `npm install`. 

2. Alternatively, 

    ```sh
    npm create astro@latest mini-auth
    cd mini-auth
    npx astro add node
    npm i lucia better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3 @lucia-auth/adapter-sqlite
    ```

    Overwrite src folder with the one provided by [the git repo](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/tree/main/astro/username-and-password).

Run `npm run dev`, the demo will show an unstyled form expecting a username with length between 3 and 31 characters, and only lowercase letters, 0-9, -, and _. Password no shorter than 6 characters.

## Modifications

So far, I have continued with

1. Tailwind CSS:

    ```sh
    npx astro add tailwind
    npm i @tailwindcss/typography daisyui@latest
    ```
    
    Adjust `tailwind.config.mjs` with `typography` and `daisyui` as in [robbins23 daisyui-admin...](https://github.com/robbins23/daisyui-admin-dashboard-template/blob/master/tailwind.config.js) or now here.
    
2. React:

    ```sh
    npx astro add react
    npm i react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers @heroicons/react
    ```
    
3. Adding forms with proper handling of errors around fetch, redirects, and styling. 

    Styling takes a lot of iterations, do not discount it.

## Doubts About Astro

There is a lot to do, like blocking everything GUI-reachable when a user submits a form, not just the form. Turn an in-memory SQLite
to an in-process file-based SQLite managed with, say, Drizzle ORM. CSRF protection and all sorts of other protections.

The only problem is that I do not find Astro to be a good React metaframework. I have encountered React warnings: [418](https://react.dev/errors/418?invariant=418), [423](https://react.dev/errors/423?invariant=423), absolute paths, very confusing ".astro" syntax (is this part HTML, or JSX, or neither). "client:load" annotations allowed only in ".astro" files. 

I am ready to bite the bullet and go with the newest Next.js. The only dilemma is whether to embrace the culture of delegation to paid 3rd party services, or continue buildings things slowly with a full control, as in this [Lucia v3 based authentication in Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/@ugurcodes/videos).

Why not to go back to MERN? It has not solved authentication, also too much Js surrounding it. On the other hand, it is not like Next.js solves a lot, though it certainly adds complexity. What a mess.
 
## Some Food for Thought

1. Wordpress and "no code" solutions.

2. ChatGPT prompt: "Describe, as briefly as possible, the difference between a library and a framework. Answer: "Library: You call the code. Framework: The framework calls your code."

3. Why do we not have anything like Blender in computer graphics or Unity/Unreal in computer games?

4. One-man army vs. big web companies: Thibault Duplessis of lichess.org fame. A single man builds a service which takes [$420K/year to run](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/s5dwdd/cost_breakdown_to_run_a_chess_website_it_takes/), entirely ad-free and donation-based. Talk about what one can do with a variable and a for loop.
