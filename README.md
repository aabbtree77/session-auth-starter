## Introduction

This is a starter template for a web app with a session-based user name and password authentication, no email communication and password resets.

Node.js, TypeScript, React, Lucia v3. A web framework is Astro, but this will change.

The code is based on "Lucia Astro User Name Password" example provided in Lucia docs.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Official "Lucia Astro UserName Password" Example

1. Clone [the demo](https://lucia-auth.com/tutorials/username-and-password/astro) sample code.

    cd to a folder and run `npm install`. 

2. Alternatively, 

    ```sh
    npm create astro@latest mini-auth
    cd mini-auth
    npx astro add node
    npm i lucia better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3 @lucia-auth/adapter-sqlite
    ```

    Overwrite src folder with the one provided by [the git repo](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/tree/main/astro/username-and-password).

Run `npm run dev`, the demo will show an unstyled form expecting a username with length between 3 and 31 characters, and only lowercase letters, 0-9, -, and _. Password no shorter than 6 characters.

## Modifications

So far, I have continued with

1. Tailwind CSS:

    ```sh
    npx astro add tailwind
    npm i @tailwindcss/typography daisyui@latest
    ```
    
    Adjust `tailwind.config.mjs` with `typography` and `daisyui` as in [robbins23 daisyui-admin...](https://github.com/robbins23/daisyui-admin-dashboard-template/blob/master/tailwind.config.js) or now here.
    
2. React:

    ```sh
    npx astro add react
    npm i react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers @heroicons/react
    ```
    
3. Adding forms with a proper handling of errors around fetch, redirects, and styling. 

    Styling takes a lot of iterations, do not discount it.

There is still a lot to do, like blocking everything GUI-reachable when a user submits a form, not just the form. Turn an in-memory SQLite
to an in-process file-based SQLite managed with, say, Drizzle ORM. CSRF protection and all sorts of other protections.

The weakest link in this whole technology stack is a metaframework.

## Why Do We Need Metaframeworks? 

The problem is React, and the desire to reuse it on the server side instead of some obscure templating.

Rendering React on the server side manually is cumbersome.

Typically, one must first convert a React component to a string, e.g. 

```jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
const htmlString = renderToString(<MyReactComp />);
```
    
JSX thus becomes an HTML which can be rendered inside, say, Hono route:

```jsx
app.get('/', (ctx) => {
return ctx.html(`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Signup Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">${htmlString}</div>
  </body>
</html>
`);
});
```

However, this is not enough and one must add "Js hydration". Since JSX needs to become Js, we must stringify the React component the second time:
    
```jsx
return ctx.html(`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Signup Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">${htmlString}</div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      const { useState } = React;
      const MyReactComp = ${MyReactComp.toString()};
      ReactDOM.hydrate(React.createElement(MyReactComp), document.getElementById('root'));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
`);
```
    
The need to split JSX/React into HTML and Js is ugly, whereas a metaframework will allow to import a React component and use it more directly.

## Doubts About Astro

Astro can serve as a React metaframework, but it is not particularly good at it:

1. The whole code base is now infected with "*.astro" which React cannot call.

2. Yet another templating language.

3. With React, Astro feels like JSX forked:

    ```astro
    <div class="min-h-screen gap-4 lg:gap-24 lg:w-3/5 mx-auto flex flex-col items-center text-base-content">
        <Header client:load />
    </div>
    ```

    Here "class" comes from HTML, but wraps a JSX/React component which would demand "className" above it in the JSX proper. The "client:load" annotation inside what looks to be a JSX syntax. This is good only when writing everything in "*.astro" with a few independent React pieces. Otherwise it will be very confusing.

4. The SSG mode produces annoying React errors which are actually just warnings: [418](https://react.dev/errors/418?invariant=418), [423](https://react.dev/errors/423?invariant=423). Not a big deal, but still.

5. "npm run build" creates only absolute paths controlled with "site" and "base", which is not enough, esp. if you want to use github pages. Manual editing will be needed.

Ultimately, Astro does avoid passing code as strings, and is easy to use with a shallow heterogeneous component interaction. However, we want everything TypeScript, not "*.astro". That is the whole point of Node.js and "the JavaScript community", is it not?!
